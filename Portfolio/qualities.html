        Besides all of the above-mentioned fifty qualities, Lord 
        Krishna possesses five more, which are sometimes partially 
        manifested in Lord Brahma or Lord Shiva. These 
        transcendental qualities are as follows:
        (51) Changeless
        (52) all-cognizant
        (53) Ever fresh
        (54) sac-cid-ananda (possessing an eternal blissful body)
        (55) Possessing all mystic perfections.
        Krishna also possesses five other qualities, which are 
        manifest in the body of Narayana / Vishnu, and they are listed 
        as follows:
        (56) He has inconceivable potency.
        (57) Uncountable universes generate from His body.
        (58) He is the original source of all incarnations.
        (59) He is the giver of salvation to the enemies whom He kills.
        (60) He is the attractor of liberated souls.
        Besides these sixty transcendental qualities, Krishna has four 
        more, which are not manifested even in the Vishnu / Narayana 
        form of Godhead, what to speak of the demigods or living 
        entities. They are as follows:
        (61) He is the performer of wonderful varieties of pastimes 
        (especially His childhood pastimes).
        (62) He is surrounded by devotees endowed with wonderful 
        love of Godhead.
        (63) He can attract all living entities all over the universes by 
        playing on His flute.
        (64) He has a wonderful excellence of beauty which cannot be 
        rivaled anywhere in the creation.
        The Absolute Truth is anandamaya (desiring to increase His 
        joy), hence from His original form He expands and becomes 
        many. These emanations from the Supreme Person are of two 
        categories: full expansions and partially manifested 
        expansions. 
        The Lord's various full and partial expansions and the Lord 
        Himself simultaneously co-exist, only appearing to manifest 
        under the influence of time. 
        These expansions of the Supreme Being are known as Vishnutattva, and they are also Supreme Absolute Truth. While nondifferent from the Lord, the Vishnu-tattvas all accept their 
        own role as Godhead in the mood of Servitor to the "original" 
        Supreme Being. 
        This relationship is the foundation of Vedic monotheism, 
        which encompasses the inconceivable, absolute personal 
        nature of the original Godhead.
        The Supreme Being possesses two other expansive qualities 
        known as Shiva-tattva and jiva-tattva. Together with Vishnutattva, these three qualities are representative of the Absolute 
        Person's internal, external and marginal energies. 
        The Lord has expanded Himself as Lord Shiva and Lord 
        Brahma, and we, the living entities, are also expansions. Like 
        us, Lord Brahma is also jiva-tattva. 
        Lord Siva is between Vishnu-tattva and jiva-tattva. And Lord 
        Visnu is Vishnu-tattva. Vishnu-tattva, via media, and jivatattva - they are all expansions of the Supreme Personality of 
        Godhead.
        Therefore we can summarize as
        Lord Krishna. 64 qualities or 100%
        Vishnu Tattva. 60 qualities or ~93%
        Shiva Tattva. 54 qualities or ~84%
        Jiva Tattva. 50 qualities or ~78%
        This is the reason why Krishna is called Param Purushottam, 
        Purnavatar or Supreme Personality of Godhead.
        Reference from (Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.29):
        Learned scholars in transcendental subjects have carefully 
        analyzed the summum bonum Krsna to have sixty-four 
        principal attributes. 
        All the expansions or categories of the Lord possess only 
        some percentages of these attributes. But Sri Krsna is the 
        possessor of the attributes cent percent. 
        And His personal expansions such as svayam-prakasa, tadekatma up to the categories of the avataras who are all visnu-
        tattva, possess up to ninety-three percent of these 
        transcendental attributes. 
        Lord Siva, who is neither avatara nor avesa nor in between 
        them, possesses almost eighty-four percent of the attributes. 
        But the jivas, or the individual living beings in different 
        statuses of life, possess up to the limit of seventy-eight percent 
        of the attributes. 
        In the conditioned state of material existence, the living being 
        possesses these attributes in very minute quantity, varying in 
        terms of the pious life of the living being. 
        The most perfect of living beings is Brahma, the supreme 
        administrator of one universe. He possesses seventy-eight 
        percent of the attributes in full. 
        All other demigods have the same attributes in less quantity, 
        whereas human beings possess the attributes in very minute 
        quantity. 
        The standard of perfection for a human being is to develop the 
        attributes up to seventy-eight percent in full. The living being 
        can never possess attributes like Siva, Visnu or Lord Krsna. 
        A living being can become godly by developing the seventy-eight-percent transcendental attributes in fullness, but he can 
        never become a God like Siva, Visnu or Krsna. He can 
        become a Brahma in due course. 
        The godly living beings who are all residents of the planets in 
        the spiritual sky are eternal associates of God in different 
        spiritual planets called Hari-dhama and Mahesa-dhama.
        The abode of Lord Krsna above all spiritual planets is called 
        Krsnaloka or Goloka Vrndavana, and the perfected living 
        being, by developing seventy-eight percent of the above 
        attributes in fullness, can enter the planet of Krsnaloka after 
        leaving the present material body.
